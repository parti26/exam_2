### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Build a static webpage displaying Naruto characters in a grid format using React, with enhanced visuals and responsiveness.

2. **Requirements**:

   - Display at least 10 Naruto characters.
   - Each character card should:
     - Display the character's name prominently.
     - Include a larger card format with improved styling (rounded corners, box shadow).
     - Use a colored circle to indicate the character's status:
       - Green circle if the character is alive.
       - Red circle if the character is deceased.
   - Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

3. **Implementation Details**:

   - Utilize React components (`App.js`) to render the character grid dynamically from a predefined array of characters.
   - Use CSS (`App.css`) to style the character cards, including card dimensions, spacing, background, and status indicators.
   - Implement CSS to adjust card layout and styling for different screen sizes.

4. **Steps**:

   - Map through characters array in your React component to dynamically render each character card.
   - Apply CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the character cards and ensure they are responsive across different devices.

5. **Deliverables**:

   - Verify that the webpage displays correctly with all specified characters and their statuses.
   - Ensure the styling adheres to the provided design guidelines, including responsiveness.
   - Submit the React component (`App.js`) and associated CSS file (`App.css`).

6. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Incorporate additional information (e.g., images, affiliations) into the character cards.
   - Implement hover effects or animations to enhance user interaction.
